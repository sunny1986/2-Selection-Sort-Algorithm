# Practice #2 - Selection Sort Algorithm
(Problem statment credits - Khan Academy https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/p/challenge-implement-selection-sort)

Implementation of Selection Sort Algorithm.

Following is the pseudocode we will follow:

1. Find the smallest number. Swap it with the first number.
2. Find the second-smallest number. Swap it with the second number.
3. Find the third-smallest number. Swap it with the third number.
4. Repeat finding the next-smallest number, and swapping it into the correct position until the array is sorted.
